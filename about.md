  <h1 class="mt1">Hi I'm Will 👋</h1>
</div>

I'm a freelance web developer in the Reno/Tahoe area. I am a problem solver specializing in building websites for businesses. My goal is to bridge the gap between the complicated nature of the internet and small business owners who just want to better their business.

**Interesting fact about me:** I have a slight obsession with [The Office](https://twitter.com/theofficenbc). If you like it too, I'm sure we'll be best buds.

## People who have enjoyed my work

    It’s rare that you find a programmer and co-founder like Will. I have had the pleasure of collaborating on multiple projects and companies with him over the years, and would jump at the opportunity to do it again. Will’s ability to deliver well thought out and tested web applications is unlike any I have seen. It's truly a joy when your developer says something is done, and it actually is. Beyond his exceptional deliverables and deep knowledge of rails, he's also willing and ready to do what it takes to get the project done. It's not a joke when I say I've come back into the office the next day before a dead line, and he's still there making sure everything is in order. Any company would greatly benefit from Will.

    [Will] is a great programmer with good communication skills. Having the experience co-running his own company makes him an ideal candidate for startups and big companies alike. He is able to relate technical and business needs and achieve results with loose and changing specifications. Great understanding of lean and test driven development. It has been a truly fun and enjoyable experience working with [Will].

# My Process

Simplicity is key in  my book. So over the years, I have found that the following process for taking on new projects works best for me an my clients.

## Step 1: Initial meeting

Every business is different. Therefore, each new project I take on I do my best to really dig into your business and work with you to figure out the best way to leverage the internet to help meet your goals.

## Step 2: The proposal

Once we have discussed those goals thoroughly, I'll be able to tell you how I (and the internet) can help. This could be anything from a simple informational website, to a full blown internet storefront.

The proposal will also include a flat project price. In my experience everyone benefits from this. You want to pay for results, not necessarily the time it takes to get them.

## Step 3: I get to work!

If you are satisfied with your options and accept the proposal, we'll sign a contract and the work begins! I will take care of building and deploying your site to the internet.

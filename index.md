  <h1 class="mt1">Hi I'm Will ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

I'm a web developer in the Reno/Tahoe area and I built <a href="https://cyberhoodie.com">CyberHoodie</a>, a web development consultancy. Do you have an idea or project you want built for the web? Well, you're in luck! <a href="https://cyberhoodie.com">CyberHoodie</a> and I can help.

**Interesting fact about me:** I have a slight obsession with [The Office](https://twitter.com/theofficenbc). If you like it too, I'm sure we'll be best buds.

## People who have enjoyed my work

<blockquote>
  <p>
  Itâ€™s rare that you find a programmer and co-founder like Will. I have had the pleasure of collaborating on multiple projects and companies with him over the years, and would jump at the opportunity to do it again. Willâ€™s ability to deliver well thought out and tested web applications is unlike any I have seen. It's truly a joy when your developer says something is done, and it actually is. Beyond his exceptional deliverables and deep knowledge of rails, he's also willing and ready to do what it takes to get the project done. It's not a joke when I say I've come back into the office the next day before a dead line, and he's still there making sure everything is in order. Any company would greatly benefit from Will.

  I had the pleasure of working with Will at Wilderness Travel, collaborating on
several different projects. I was particularly impressed by his ability to break
down common design elements into reusable components, leaving the company's
codebase to be easily maintainable. Besides his technical competence, his
positive mindset to continuously learn and excel would be a true asset to any
team.Â

  [Will] is a great programmer with good communication skills. Having the experience co-running his own company makes him an ideal candidate for startups and big companies alike. He is able to relate technical and business needs and achieve results with loose and changing specifications. Great understanding of lean and test driven development. It has been a truly fun and enjoyable experience working with [Will].

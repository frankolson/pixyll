<h1>You don't want a website.</h1>

<p>
  Well maybe you do, I don't know. But my guess is, what you actually want is to grow your business and you're finding the internet to be the best place to do that.
</p>

<p>
  Websites are a great way to:
  <ul>
    <li>Attract new customers</li>
    <li>Build credibility</li>
    <li>Make a good first impression</li>
    <li>Inform customers even after business hours</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I'm also guessing that all of the technical jargon that goes along with using the internet is slowing down the process. You have a business to start/run and a million other things to worry about.
</p>

<p>That's where I come in.</p>
